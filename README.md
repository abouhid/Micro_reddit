# Micro-reddit Project
  The aim of this project is practicing what we have learned about Active Record, Migrations, Associations and Validations. We have created the back-end of a blog in which you can:
* Create an author's username, email and password;
* Create author's posts which have a body and a title;
* Add comments to the posts created, witch body and title.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
